In the context of web development, a server is a computer system or software that provides services to other computer programs (and their users) in the same or other computers. In your scenario, the server is where your Java web application runs, processes requests, and sends responses back to the client's browser.

Breakdown of the Concept:
Web Server:

A web server is software that serves web pages to users. It handles HTTP requests from clients (usually web browsers) and responds with HTML pages, images, or other resources. Apache Tomcat is an example of a web server that can serve Java web applications.
Servlet Container (Application Server):

In the case of Java web applications, a servlet container (like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or GlassFish) is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping requests to servlets, and ensuring that web applications are accessible to clients. It handles the execution of servlets and JSP pages, processes the requests, and generates responses.
Backend Code (Servlets, JSP):

When a form is submitted, the data is sent to a servlet, which is a Java program running on the server. The servlet processes the data, interacts with the database if needed, performs business logic, and generates a response, often in the form of an HTML page.
Example Scenario
Let's walk through an example to see how this works in practice:

Client (Browser):
User Action:
The user fills out a login form on a webpage and clicks the "Login" button.
html




Copy code
<form action="<%=request.getContextPath()%>/AppController" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>



Server (Servlet Container like Apache Tomcat):
Form Submission:

The form data is sent to the URL specified in the action attribute, which maps to a servlet on the server.
Servlet Processing:

The servlet (AppController in this case) processes the form data. Here's a simplified example of what the servlet code might look like:
java




Copy code
@WebServlet("/AppController")
public class AppController extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");

        // Process the login
        if ("anurag".equals(username) && "1234567890".equals(password)) {
            // Authentication successful
            response.sendRedirect("welcome.jsp");
        } else {
            // Authentication failed
            response.sendRedirect("error.jsp");
        }
    }
}



Server Response:
The servlet performs some logic (e.g., checking the credentials), and then sends a response back to the client (e.g., redirecting to a welcome page if the login is successful or an error page if it fails).
Web Server Role:
Handling HTTP Requests:

The web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat) handles the incoming HTTP request, maps it to the appropriate servlet, and forwards the request to it.
Generating Responses:

Once the servlet finishes processing, the web server sends the generated response back to the client's browser.



In Summary:
Server: In this context, the server refers to the servlet container (like Apache Tomcat) that runs your Java web application. It handles HTTP requests from clients, executes the corresponding servlets, and sends back HTTP responses.
Servlet: A Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses. It processes the data submitted through the form and generates the appropriate response.
Understanding the Flow:
Client (Browser) sends HTTP request via a form submission.
Web Server (Apache Tomcat) receives the request.
Servlet Container maps the request to a servlet.
Servlet (Java code) processes the request.
Web Server sends the response back to the client.
This entire process allows for dynamic interaction between the client and the server, enabling features like user authentication, data submission, and content generation on the fly.
